    <div id="title"> Daniel, Elton John </div>

  <p> This is a video of the lyrics to Elton John’s song named Daniel.  This song was written by Elton John’s writing partner and edited by Elton John: it was released in “Don’t Shoot Me, I am only a Piano Player” album in 1973.   The reason behind this song is that the writer had been seeing articles about what happens to veterans when they return, and he felt for them.  This song is about a brother of a Vietnam veteran.  The war had been going on for decades and ended a mere two years after this song was released.  This song discussed a man missing his older brother who keeps going to Spain because he cannot face the hard reality of his past, so he escapes to Spain.  The narrator explains his brother jetting off to Spain yet again and that he has scars and dead eyes from what he had seen in the past. </p>

<p>The purpose of this song is to enlighten the public on the harsh reality of war and how it affects people greatly (even after they return).  The intended audience is Elton John’s fans, veterans, and families.  The veterans and families can sympathies for this character in the song and feel connected to the song because they are going through the same.  The actual audience is a much greater group than Elton John’s fans and those with a connection to war veterans.  In reality this song was a huge hit and reached number 1 on the adult’s contemporary charters for a few weeks during the month of its release. </p>

<p>This song was a great way to connect Elton John and his music to the people.  When viewers listened to the song they have an emotional appeal because of the slow tune and graphic and sad lyrics. Examples of these are when he describes the scars or describes the “clouds in my eyes” (from the ‘brothers’ perspective).  This song also shows the heroism of veterans by adding in “you are a star in the face of the sky,” when discussing the veteran.  All of this is utilizing pathos and he did this through singing a story, which makes logical sense.  This song stuck with the people since it was a description of the countries current mood and struggles, and sympathized with and explained the bravery of the veterans and their families. </p>

  <div id="title"> It's On Us: Sexual Assault PSA</div>

  <p>This video appeared on the “It’s on Us” website and YouTube on September 18, 2014.  The video is raising awareness of sexual assault and the website is a place where you can publicly (via social media) pledge that you will recognize, identify, and intervene on sexual assault.  The video begins with faces with a white backdrop.  Half the screen would be them speaking, about it being on us, and the other half would be them wearing “It’s on Us” apparel.  The people in this video were not just your average citizens, but they were celebrities and politicians.  We begin with the famous John Hamm with a solemn yet determined look saying “It is on us to stop sexual assault.”  Within the first three seconds of the video they explicitly say their general purpose. More specifically, the purpose is to get people to pledge and be aware of the severe sexual assault problem and help the cause.  </p>

<p>As the video progresses we see more actors and actresses including Kerry Washington, Joel McHale, and Rose Byrne.  They each say how it is on us to stop sexual harassment.  The repetition is a key rhetorical device to get the saying and idea ingrained in the audiences head.  Then in the last 10 seconds the people speaking makes a change.  Vice President, Joe Biden, appears on the screen and says the same thing as the celebrities.  Finally, President Barack Obama ends the video with “Learn how and take the pledge on itsonus.org.”  This video went from serving an audience that respects celebrities to an audience who respects the president.  The video is going to appeal to a larger group of people because the fans of each celebrity with see this as well as the general American citizens because the White House made their statements as well.  The diversity of people show how important this cause is, and the fact that even the President is involved implies it is a big problem.</p>

<p>This video appeals to pathos because of the slow music and serious and sincere faces.  Most individuals will have a emotional connections to one or more of the individuals on the video as well.  There is not one smile in this video.  It also appeals to logos because it gives examples of how to help and it logically makes sense. Finally, it appeals to ethos because the President of the United States of America took a stand, as did the rest of the celebrities.</p>
