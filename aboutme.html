 <p>Hello! My name is <font color="#8B8805">Zoe Zappitell</font>, and I designed this website.  I am a student at Michigan State University and am majoring in Professional Writing.  I love designing esthetically pleasing documents and websites as well as making difficult documents easier to grasp.  My hobbies include: photography, traveling, cooking, and spending time with my younger sister.  My life goals include: having children and finding a career that truly makes me happy.  This website is nonconventional in the sense of its orginilatiy.  I started with a blank canvas and attempted to create a unique and stimulating platoform for rhetorical analysis.  I hope you enjoy this website!
