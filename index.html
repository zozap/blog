  <p> This is a video of the lyrics to Elton John’s song named Daniel.  This song was written by Elton John’s writing partner and edited by Elton John: it was released in “Don’t Shoot Me, I am only a Piano Player” album in 1973.   The reason behind this song is that the writer had been seeing articles about what happens to veterans when they return, and he felt for them.  This song is about a brother of a Vietnam veteran.  The war had been going on for decades and ended a mere two years after this song was released.  This song discussed a man missing his older brother who keeps going to Spain because he cannot face the hard reality of his past, so he escapes to Spain.  The narrator explains his brother jetting off to Spain yet again and that he has scars and dead eyes from what he had seen in the past. </p>

<p>The purpose of this song is to enlighten the public on the harsh reality of war and how it affects people greatly (even after they return).  The intended audience is Elton John’s fans, veterans, and families.  The veterans and families can sympathies for this character in the song and feel connected to the song because they are going through the same.  The actual audience is a much greater group than Elton John’s fans and those with a connection to war veterans.  In reality this song was a huge hit and reached number 1 on the adult’s contemporary charters for a few weeks during the month of its release. </p>

<p>This song was a great way to connect Elton John and his music to the people.  When viewers listened to the song they have an emotional appeal because of the slow tune and graphic and sad lyrics. Examples of these are when he describes the scars or describes the “clouds in my eyes” (from the ‘brothers’ perspective).  This song also shows the heroism of veterans by adding in “you are a star in the face of the sky,” when discussing the veteran.  All of this is utilizing pathos and he did this through singing a story, which makes logical sense.  This song stuck with the people since it was a description of the countries current mood and struggles, and sympathized with and explained the bravery of the veterans and their families. </p>
